This project was created for as a class assignment for The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. The premise was to create to an internal-facing full stack web application for a school where the user can view, add, edit, and delete information on campuses and students. 

On the back end, requests are handled with Express and information is stored in a PostgreSQL database via Sequelize as the ORM.

On the front end, state is managed with Redux, and the user interface with React.
