# Junior Phase Final Project

**Demo Video: https://youtu.be/azNvPoNHWL8**

This project was created as a class assignment for The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. The premise was to create to an internal-facing full stack web application for a school where the user can view, add, edit, and delete information on campuses and students. 

On the back end, requests are handled with Express, and information is stored in a PostgreSQL database via Sequelize as the ORM.

On the front end, state is managed by Redux, and the user interface is built with React.
